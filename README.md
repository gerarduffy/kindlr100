"Dating for Books"

--------------------------
SPRINT 1 DOCUMENTATION

Major Improvements to application since Project 2.3:

a) Adding tags to posts 

  i) Users can now add a tag to their posts, which will later serve a major function in search/filter project we have planned for upcoming iterations.
  
b) Adding image functionality to our application so that users can display a picture of their book on the swipe cards

  i)This gives greater functionality to people posting by being able to add a picture and show the condition of their book (or just an image they choose off the internet).

Planned Improvements that got pushed to Sprint 2:

a) Adding "Sale" functionality

  i) This functionality is currently being worked on, however, it will not be finished by this iteration, so it was not completely pushed back to Sprint 2.
  
b) Filtering based on tags

  i) This was completely pushed to the second sprint. We ran into issues with dynamic addition of tags to posts that pushed back this goal completely to the next iteration.
