"Dating for Books"

--------------------------
SPRINT 1 DOCUMENTATION

Major Improvements to application since Project 2.3:

a) Adding tags to posts 

  i) Users can now add a tag to their posts, which will later serve a major function in search/filter project we have planned for upcoming iterations.
  
b) Adding image functionality to our application so that users can display a picture of their book on the swipe cards

  i)This gives greater functionality to people posting by being able to add a picture and show the condition of their book (or just an image they choose off the internet).

Planned Improvements that got pushed to Sprint 2:

a) Adding "Sale" functionality

  i) This functionality is currently being worked on, however, it will not be finished by this iteration, so it was not completely pushed back to Sprint 2.
  
b) Filtering based on tags

  i) This was completely pushed to the second sprint. We ran into issues with dynamic addition of tags to posts that pushed back this goal completely to the next iteration.

  SPRINT 2 DOCUMENTATION
  
  Major Improvements since Sprint 1:
  
 a) Adding image functionality to support URLs instead of referencing a local picture
 
  i) The image functionality was changed to revolve around URLs instead of references to local directories. This gives a greater networking component to our application.
  
  ii) Option for URL is given when a user is adding a post to their library
  
 b) Adding "Sale" functionality
 
  i) Users can set a Post as a "Sale"
  
  ii) Users can set a price for said "Sale"
  
  iii) Users can buy books instead of a pure book swap
  
  TODO List:
  
  a) Filter books on the home screen based on tags
  
   i) This serves as the search function
    
   b) General UI improvements - we want our app to look good!
